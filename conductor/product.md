# Initial Concept

Shallot.rs is a Zero-JS Rust UI Component Library - a manifesto written in code that proves you can have breathtaking aesthetics (glassmorphism, advanced physics-based animations, and complex interactivity) using only Rust and Modern CSS, with absolutely zero client-side JavaScript.

## Core Beliefs

- **Zero JavaScript**: 0 bytes of client-side JavaScript, fully functional on TOR and NoScript environments
- **Iron Logic**: Rust's type system and Phantom Types for Finite State Machines (FSM) in every component
- **Refractive Beauty**: "Bionic Naturalism" with CSS anchor positioning, backdrop filters, and hardware-accelerated transitions
- **State of the Art Standards**: 100% Type-Safe, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant by default, sub-100ms first paints

## Architecture (The Allium Model)

1. **The Bulb (Logic)**: Pure Rust core defining component behavior and valid state transitions
2. **The Skin (Structure)**: Maud templates generating ultra-lean, semantic HTML
3. **The Aura (Style)**: Typed Design System compiling tokens into minified CSS variables

## Current State

- 129 COMPLETE components with CSS, tests, and accessibility
- Interactive website with component showcase
- RSS feed, dark mode, community themes marketplace
- Vercel deployment configured
